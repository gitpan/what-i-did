NAME
    what-i-did - Track what you did

DESCRIPTION
    This tool supports you in efficiently tracking what you did (if that
    matters for you). For example if you do work you are payed for by
    time what-i-did helps you keeping track of your work.

    Once started just an icon appears in your toolbar. Click on it
    to get an input field and enter what you are doing now. If you
    often switch between different projects just enter its name at
    first, delimited by a colon, and then what you're doing in detail:
    
      what-i-did: writing README
    
    what-i-did notes your input together with a timestamp into a
    simple text file you may edit by hand every time. what-i-did
    urges you to nothing, it just tries to support you in a simply
    and subtle fashion.
    
    The text box has context sensitive searching abilities. Once you
    start typing a popup appears with matching items of your what-i-did
    history. Before you start typing a list with the latest popular
    items pops up immediately. Just pick on by mouse and you're done.
    
    Later it comes to summing up the time you needed for specific
    projects. By right clicking the what-i-did icon a menu pops up.
    Choose "Sum up times..." to open the correspondent dialog.
    
    You get a list view of all activites in the what-i-did log. Select
    all items you want to sum up as one entry. what-i-did calculates
    the exact amount of time for you and combines all your comments
    into one line, optionally omitting the project tag (can be
    configured in the Preferences menu). Copy these items to your
    invoice sheet (e.g. OpenOffice Calc or similar). what-i-did does
    not generate full reports, for this task use an external application
    which does this job better. Because the requirements for this are
    very specific what-i-did doesn't cover this (yet).

REQUIRES
    Perl & the following Perl modules:
    - Gtk2
    - Locale::TextDomain

INSTALLATION
    sudo cp what-i-did /usr/local/bin

FILES
    ~/what-i-did.txt
        Default filename of the what-i-did activity logfile. You
        may edit it by hand, but keep the time formatting intact!

    ~/.config/what-i-did/settings.conf
        Your configuration settings. You may edit this file but
        better use the configuration submenu of the status icon.
        
        To customise the text snippets of the default activity
        icons just edit the "item-text-*" keys here. They are
        currently not available via the configuration menu.

    ~/.config/what-i-did/.data/gfx/*.png
        Icon files shipped with what-i-did. If you like to customise
        these, just place your version in ~/.config/what-i-did/

    ~/.config/what-i-did/*.png
        Your customised icon files.
